# AutoJudge Difficulty Predictor

A machine learning system that automatically assesses programming problem difficulty through both classification and regression models. The system processes textual problem descriptions and provides dual predictions: categorical difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard) and numerical difficulty scores.

## Key Features

- **Dual Prediction Models**: Both classification (Easy/Medium/Hard) and regression (numerical scores)
- **Text Analysis**: Processes problem titles, descriptions, input/output specifications
- **Web Interface**: React-based UI for problem input and result visualization
- **ML Pipeline**: Feature extraction with TF-IDF vectorization and statistical analysis
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and graceful error recovery

## Target Users

- Programming contest organizers
- Educational platform administrators
- Problem setters and reviewers
- Automated judging systems

## Core Value Proposition

Automates the traditionally manual and subjective process of difficulty assessment, providing consistent and data-driven difficulty predictions for programming problems.
