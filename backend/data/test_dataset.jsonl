Together they store their bands,\n    Benzes, bings, bonbons and buns in Ben\u2019s bins.\nBen has $n$ bins\n    altogether arranged in a single row, numbered $1$ to $n$. While not all of the bins may be\n    in use at any given time, Ben finds it useful to keep all the\n    bins for one company contiguous. Thus, when a company needs a\n    new bin or relinquishes one it no longer needs, Ben may need to\n    move items from one bin to another to make sure all of that\n    company\u2019s bins stay next to each other. Sometimes Ben has a\n    choice of which bin to move, so he has assigned a cost to each\n    bin equal to the number of items stored in the bin (removing\n    items from a relinquished bin and/or moving items into a new\n    bin are the company\u2019s responsibility and do not add to Ben\u2019s\n    costs). Obviously when moving bins Ben wants to keep the cost\n    as low as possible.\nIf a single company has to make changes Ben can usually\n    figure out the cheapest way to move items around, but typically\n    at the end of each business quarter all of the five companies\n    will make additions and deletions of bins as they reassess\n    their product lines. In cases like this, deciding the\n    lowest-cost set of moves is more difficult.

{"title": "Wet Tiles", "description": "Alice owns a construction company in the town of Norainia,\n    famous for its unusually dry weather. In fact, it only rains a\n    few days per year there. Because of this phenomenon, many\n    residents of Norainia neglect to do roof repairs until leaks\n    occur and ruin their floors. Every year, Alice receives a\n    deluge of calls from residents who need the leaks fixed and\n    floor tiles replaced. While exquisite in appearance, Norainia\n    floor tiles are not very water resistant; once a tile becomes\n    wet, it is ruined and must be replaced. This year, Alice plans\n    to handle the rainy days more efficiently than in past years.\n    She will hire extra contractors to dispatch as soon as the\n    calls come in, so hopefully all leaks can be repaired as soon\n    as possible. For each house call, Alice needs a program to help\n    her determine how many replacement tiles a contractor team will\n    need to bring to complete the job.\nFor a given house, square floor tiles are arranged in a\n    rectangular grid. Leaks originate from one or more known source\n    locations above specific floor tiles. After the first minute,\n    the tiles immediately below the leaks are ruined. After the\n    second minute, water will have spread to any tile that shares\n    an edge with a previously wet tile. This pattern of spreading\n    water continues for each additional minute. However, the walls\n    of a house restrict the water; if a damaged area hits a wall,\n    the water does not penetrate the wall. We assume there are\n    always four outer walls surrounding the entire house. A house\n    may also have a number of additional \u201cinner\u201d walls; each inner\n    wall is comprised of a connected linear sequence of locations\n    (which may or may not be connected to the outer walls or to\n    each other).\nAs an example, Figure 1 shows water damage (in gray) that\n    would result from three initial leaks (each marked with a white\n    letter \u2018L\u2019) after each of the first five minutes of time.

The black areas designate inner walls\n    that restrict the flow of water. Note that after $5$ minutes, a total of $75$ tiles have been damaged and will\n    need to be replaced.

{"title": "Association for Cool Machineries (Part 1)", "description": "You are the boss of ACM\n    (Association for Cool Machineries), an upstanding company with\n    a single goal of world domination.\nLike all other world domination oriented villains, you dream\n    of having a gigantic evil robot doing evil deeds. I mean, is\n    there anyone who can resist the urge of having your own\n    personal gigantic laser-firing robot? Thus, it is to your\n    ultimate joy when the scientific committee of ACM told you about their success in inventing\n    a prototype for the GL-bot (shorthand for Giant Laser\n    Robot).\nAs a demonstration, they have placed GL-bot on a field\n    modeled as an $N \\times N$\n    grid. Each cell in the grid is either empty or impassable. All\n    cells on the borders of the grid are impassable. GL-bot is\n    initially located on one of these empty cells.\nThe GL-bot\u2019s behavior is programmed with a string of length\n    at most $N$. Each\n    character in the string is either <, >,\n    ^, or v,\n    denoting four directions of movement. GL-bot will continuously\n    move on the grid according to this string. The movement works\n    as follows. GL-bot considers the characters in the string one\n    by one, starting from the first character until the last\n    character, and then loop back to the first character and\n    repeat. GL-bot performs a movement depending on the character\n    being considered (for the images below, black cells denote\n    impassable cells, while white cells denote empty cells):\n<: GL-bot moves to the left\n        one step, if able.\n\n>: GL-bot moves to the\n        right one step, if able.\n\nv: GL-bot moves down one step,\n        if able.\n\n^: GL-bot moves up one step,\n        if able.\n\nMore specifically, GL-bot moves one cell from its current\n    location to the location as determined by the character.\n    However, if the new location is impassable, the robot does not\n    perform the move, and this movement is skipped. GL-bot then\n    considers the next character in the program.\nThe trail of GL-bot is the (possibly infinite) sequence of\n    (possibly non-distinct) cells of the grid that GL-bot traverses\n    in order. The trail can be viewed to be generated as follows:\n    initially, before GL-bot performs any movement, the trail\n    contains one element: the initial location of GL-bot. Whenever\n    GL-bot moves into a different cell, the new location of GL-bot\n    is added to the trail. In particular, this implies that no two\n    consecutive cells in the trail are the same \u2014 if the robot is\n    unable to move in a particular direction because it was\n    occupied by an impassable cell, the trail is not extended.\nYou giggle giddily as you watch GL-bot move. For some\n    program and for some grid configuration, GL-bot will never stop\n    moving, no matter how long time has passed. It can be proven\n    that in this case, the trail will eventually end up repeating a\n    continuous subsequence of itself. But you\u2026, you don\u2019t see such\n    a thing. What you see is a robot that moves perpetually, as if\n    it is sapient. Your fascination with GL-bot leaves the\n    scientific committee worried, as GL-bot is not actually sapient\n    yet (it just needs a few more tweaks). Thus, they attempt to\n    convince you by showing that the movement is simply follows a\n    pattern. If the length of the trail of the robot is finite, you\n    should output $1$.\n    Otherwise, let $X$ be the\n    smallest integer such that the suffix of the trail will be a\n    repetition of a continuous subsequence of the trail of length\n    exactly $X$.

Bj0rn is preparing to achieve top scores in \u201cGuitar\n    Hero Live\u201d, but he needs your help in figuring out what the\n    maximum score is for all the new songs. Apparently, the new\n    game has something called Hero Power, but Bj0rn is betting that\n    it really is the same thing as the \u201cStar Power\u201d that has always\n    been in these games.\n\u201cGuitar Hero\u2019s\u201d scoring essentially works as follows: the\n    player advances along a note chart and scores one point for\n    each note he hits. Bj0rn will settle for nothing less than\n    perfection; every note will be hit!\nHowever, there\u2019s an added twist: \u201cStar Power!\u201d\u2014simply called\n    SP. Every now and then, a streak of star-shaped notes\n    appear on the note chart. These streaks are SP\n    phrases. When between the first and last note of an SP\n    phrase, the player has the ability to charge up a so-called\n    SP meter, which stores the amount of time the player\n    has spent charging it. You can start charging at the exact\n    moment of the first note and all the way up till the last note.\n    You can also pause charging at any time and you do not have to\n    use the accumulated SP immediately after you stop charging, so\n    it is possible to accumulate SP charge from multiple\n    phrases.\nWhen the SP meter contains a positive amount of seconds, at\n    any point in the song\u2014even at the exact moment of a note\u2014the\n    player is free to activate Star Power. From this\n    moment, the SP meter starts draining until it is completely\n    empty. For example, if it contains $\\pi + {\\root 4 \\of {7}}$ seconds of\n    SP, it will take $\\pi + {\\root 4\n    \\of {7}}$ seconds to drain completely. During an\n    activation, every note is worth two points as long as the SP\n    meter is non-empty! In particular, if you start activating at\n    the exact moment of a note, that note is already worth two\n    points and if you hit a note during the last moment of\n    activation, that note is only worth one point, because the SP\n    meter has just become empty.\nThere is a downside to activating Star Power. If an SP\n    activation overlaps with an SP phrase and the SP meter is\n    positive at some point during the overlap, the SP phrase\n    degrades back to plain notes. In particular, if you hit the\n    first note of an SP phrase on the exact moment when the SP\n    meter drains to $0$, the\n    SP phrase is not degraded. It\u2019s fine to activate mid-phrase,\n    but the rest of the phrase still suffers from the overlap and\n    disappears, so you can not charge more Star Power from that\n    phrase.\nCan you help Bj0rn find the best strategy and figure out how\n    many points he can get?\n", "input_description": "The first line of input consists of two integers\n    $1 \\leq n \\leq 50\\, 000$\n    and $0 \\leq p \\leq 100$,\n    the number of notes and SP phrases respectively.

{"title": "ISBN Conversion", "description": "An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is a unique\n    identifier assigned to a distinct edition/version of a\n    published book (for example, hardcover and paperback versions\n    of the same edition get different ISBNs). ISBNs assigned before\n    2007 were $10$ digits long\n    (the ISBN-10\n    standard), and ISBNs assigned on or after January\u00a01, 2007,\n    are $13$ digits long (the\n    ISBN-13 standard).\n    Some books issued before 2007 that are still in print have both\n    an original ISBN-10\n    and a matching ISBN-13, and some newer books are also given both\n    an ISBN-10 and an\n    ISBN-13, the former\n    for backward-compatibility purposes. That \u201cdouble identity\u201d\n    situation is the basis for this problem, which requires you to\n    convert valid ISBN-10s\n    to their corresponding ISBN-13s.\nThe last digit of any ISBN is a checksum digit that\n    can be used for simple error detection. ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 use different rules for\n    computing/verifying this last digit:\nISBN-10: If the\n        $10$ digits from left\n        to right are $d_1, d_2,\n        \\ldots , d_{10}$ (so $d_{10}$ is the checksum digit),\n        and if\n(coefficients decrease from $10$ to $1$), then $S$ must be a multiple\n        $\\textrm{of }11$,\n        i.e., $S \\equiv 0$\n$(\\textrm{mod\n        }11)$.\nISBN-13: If the\n        $13$ digits from left\n        to right are $d_1, d_2,\n        \\ldots , d_{13}$ (so $d_{13}$ is the checksum digit),\n        and if\n(odd-indexed digits are multiplied by $1$, even-indexed digits are\n        multiplied $\\textrm{by\n        }3$), then $S$\n        must be a multiple $\\textrm{of }10$, i.e.,\n        $S \\equiv 0$\n$(\\textrm{mod\n        }10)$.\nIt is not hard to see that each rule uniquely determines the\n    checksum digit (given the other digits).\nX Factor: Note the following small but important\n    detail for ISBN-10\n    that does not apply to ISBN-13: because the modulus $\\textrm{is }11$, the value of the\n    checksum digit lies in $\\{ 0, 1,\n    2, \\ldots , 9, 10\\} $, and in the special case that the\n    value of the checksum digit $\\textrm{is }10$, it is written\n    as\u00a0X so that only one character is required. So, for\n    example, $039428013\\textrm{X}$ is a valid\n    ISBN-10.\nHyphens: Technically an ISBN-10 consists of four parts, one of which is\n    the checksum digit. (The exact rules defining the first three\n    parts are complicated, so we will not deal with them here.) Two\n    adjacent parts can optionally be separated by a hyphen, which\n    means that an ISBN-10\n    may contain up to three hyphens, but it cannot begin or end\n    with a hyphen, and it cannot contain consecutive hyphens. If\n    there are three hyphens, one must separate the checksum digit\n    from the digit that precedes it (if there are fewer than three\n    hyphens, there may or may not be a hyphen between the checksum\n    digit and the digit that precedes it). So, for the purposes of\n    this problem, the following are valid ISBN-10s:\nAnd the following are invalid ISBN-10s (the first two because of a\n    hyphen-placement error, the last because it fails the checksum\n    test above):\nHow do you convert an ISBN-10 to an ISBN-13? Simply (i)\u00a0prepend the three digits\n    $978$, (ii)\u00a0remove\n    the old checksum digit, and (iii)\u00a0append a new checksum\n    digit as determined by the ISBN-13 rule.1 To keep things\n    simple, maintain the positions of any existing hyphens, and\n    follow the prepended 978 with a hyphen.\n", "input_description": "The first line of input contains an integer, $T$ $(1\n    \\leq T \\leq 25)$, the number of (possibly invalid)\n    ISBN-10s to process.\n    This is followed by $T$\n    lines, each of which contains a nonempty string of length\n    between $10$ and\n    $13$, inclusive.

Two\n    players, Alob and Bice join the game. At the beginning, Alob is\n    at node $s_ a$ while Bice\n    is at node $s_ b$. Alob\n    starts first. Two players take turn alternatively. In each\n    turn, a player has to move from his current node, along some\n    edge to another node; and may pay, collect money or buy\n    property, depending on the type of the new node. If he can not\n    choose any edges to pass through, he has to pass that turn (do\n    nothing).\n\nEvery node belongs to one of the following types:\nProperty: You can purchase to\n        own this property and force your opponents to pay you when\n        they reach here. Each property has its own buying cost and renting\n        cost. Initially, all properties are unowned. When you\n        reach an unowned property, you can decide either to buy\n        this property (you have to pay its buying cost) to permanently own it, or to ignore. After you\n        purchase for this property, your opponent has to send you\n        an amount of money equal to its renting\n        cost everytime he reaches it. Of course, you have\n        nothing to do while landing on your own properties.\nSalary: Each node of this kind\n        has its own value, which is the amount of money you gain\n        everytime you reach this.\nTax: Each node of this kind has\n        its own value, which is the amount of money you lose when\n        you reach this node.\nSince Alob and Bice are bored of playing an overlong game,\n    each person will take at most $K$ turns (including passed turns).\n    After that, the game ends. They had already won the gameshow\n    Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? so they\n    never worry about running out of cash. Each player wants his\n    money to be more than his opponent\u2019s money as much as possible.\n    If he has several strategies resulting in the same difference,\n    he always prefers the one giving him largest amount of\n    money.\nAssume that both player play optimally, your task is to\n    determine the outcome of the game.\n", "input_description": "The first line contains five integers: $N$, $M$, $K$, $s_\n    a$, $s_ b$ - the\n    number of nodes and edges in the graph, the maximum number of\n    turns each player takes, and the starting nodes of Alob and\n    Bice, respectively.", "output_description": "Write out in one line two space-separated integers denoting\n    the amount of money Alob and Bice gain at the end of the game,\n    respectively.", "problem_class": "Medium", "problem_score": 7.4}

Being a clever inventor himself,\n    the organizer soon found an objective way of doing the room\n    assignments in a fair manner: each inventor wrote two different\n    room numbers on a fair coin, one room number on each side.\n    Then, each inventor threw his coin and was assigned the room\n    number which was shown on the upper side of his coin. If some\n    room had been assigned to more than one inventor, all inventors\n    had to throw their coins again.\nAs you can imagine, this assignment process could take a\n    long time or even not terminate at all.

Functions can be defined over any domain\n    and any codomain.\nIn this problem we will be looking at partial\n    functions, which map some subset of the elements of the\n    domain to the co-domain. For instance, $f(x) = \\sqrt {x}$ is a partial\n    function but not a function on the domain of real numbers,\n    since it only defined for the non-negative numbers.\nThere are two key properties a partial function may\n    have.\nA partial function can be injective (or\n        one-to-one), which means that any value in the\n        codomain can be produced by at most one value from the\n        domain. The function $f(x) =\n        x^2$ is not injective if we define its\n        domain and codomain both as the real numbers (since\n        $3^2 = 9$, but also\n        $(-3)^2 = 9$).\n        However, if we define its domain as the non-negative real\n        numbers, then it is injective.\nA partial function can be surjective (or\n        onto), which means that every value in the\n        codomain can be produced by the function.

He wants to share this finding with his fellow\n    gardener Tommy but he does not want anyone to steal the\n    procedure. So the two gardeners agreed upon using a\u00a0simple\n    encryption technique proposed by M.\u00a0E.\u00a0Ohaver.\nThe encryption is based on the Morse code, which represents\n    characters as variable-length sequences of dots and dashes. The\n    following table shows the Morse code sequences for all\n    letters:\nA\n.-\nH\n....\nO\n---\nV\n...-\nB\n-...\nI\n..\nP\n.--.\nW\n.--\nC\n-.-.\nJ\n.---\nQ\n--.-\nX\n-..-\nD\n-..\nK\n-.-\nR\n.-.\nY\n-.--\nE\n.\nL\n.-..\nS\n...\nZ\n--..\nF\n..-.\nM\n--\nT\n-\nG\n--.\nN\n-.\nU\n..-\nNote that four possible dot-dash combinations are\n    unassigned. For the purposes of this problem we will assign\n    them as follows (note these are not the assignments for actual\n    Morse code):\nunderscore (\u201c_\u201d)\n..--\nperiod (\u201c.\u201d)\n---.\ncomma (\u201c,\u201d)\n.-.-\nquestion mark (\u201c?\u201d)\n----\nIn practice, characters in a\u00a0message are delimited by\n    short pauses, typically displayed as spaces. Thus, the message\n    \u201cACM_GREATER_NY_REGION\u201d is encoded as:\n    \u00a0 .- -.-. -- ..-- --.\n    .-. . .- - . .-. ..-- -. -.-- ..-- .-. . --. .. ---\n    -.\nThe Ohaver\u2019s encryption scheme is based on mutilating Morse\n    code, namely by removing the pauses between letters. Since the\n    pauses are necessary (because Morse is a\u00a0variable-length\n    encoding that is not prefix-free), a\u00a0string is added that\n    identifies the number of dots and dashes in each character. For\n    example, consider the message \u201c.--.-.--\u201d.\n    Without knowing where the pauses should be, this could be\n    \u201cACM\u201d, \u201cANK\u201d, or\n    several other possibilities. If we add length information, such\n    as \u201c.--.-.--\u00a0242\u201d, then the code is\n    unambiguous.\nOhaver\u2019s scheme has three steps, the same for encryption and\n    decryption:\nConvert the text to Morse code without pauses but with\n        a\u00a0string of numbers to indicate code lengths.\nReverse the string of numbers.\nConvert the dots and dashes back into the text using the\n        reversed string of numbers as code lengths.\nAs an example, consider the encrypted message \u201cAKADTOF_IBOETATUK_IJN\u201d. Converting to Morse code with\n    a\u00a0length string yields:\n    \u00a0 .--.-.--..----..-...--..-...---.-.--..--.-..--...----.\u00a0232313442431121334242\u00a0\n    By reversing the numbers and decoding, we get the original\n    message \u201cACM_GREATER_NY_REGION\u201d.\nThe security of this encoding scheme is not too high but\n    Freddy believes it is sufficient for his purposes.

{"title": "Floating Formation", "description": "Industrial design students have come up with an amazing\n    idea: they have made some awesome pieces of design and they\n    want to showcase them floating on the water of the IJsselmeer!\n    Unfortunately, their designs do not stay afloat by themselves,\n    so they took a few boats and used them to tie designs\n    together.\nThe left and right sides of a boat have rope connection\n    points that can be tied to designs. A boat can therefore be\n    attached to at most two designs. A design that is connected to\n    two or more boats will stay afloat indefinitely. Unfortunately,\n    designs that are connected to only one boat will not float\n    properly: the part of the design furthest away from the boat\n    will sink a bit and be partially in the water, so it will soak,\n    making the design heavier, which will eventually sink the\n    design, making it too heavy for the boat to keep afloat. A boat\n    that is attached to a design that has sunk will detach itself\n    from the other design it is attached to, if applicable, and\n    will carry the soaked design back to shore. Designs that are\n    soaked are placed on the beach, but the students want the ship\n    that brought the design to shore to stay attached to the soaked\n    design, as they feel this composition has artistic value. The\n    boat will therefore not go back to the designs that are still\n    floating, which means that if the boat was attached to another\n    design, that design loses a supporting boat and will also start\n    to sink!\nKeeping the above in mind, there are simple ways to string\n    the designs together with boats so that no design sinks, such\n    as forming a circle. This is not the approach that the students\n    used: their approach involved much creativity. The result,\n    although a single connected component, is a configuration that\n    leaves many designs connected by only one boat and hence in\n    danger of sinking. You also note that the students have always\n    attached boats to two designs: there are no boats that are\n    attached to a single design. Also, boats can never be attached\n    to a single design twice, and there are no two boats that are\n    attached to the same pair of designs.\nReluctantly, the students have admitted that they may have\n    made mistakes, so they have asked you to use the few boats they\n    have left to keep as many designs afloat as possible. As the\n    current configuration has much artistic value, you are not\n    allowed to change it. In fact, you are only allowed to use the\n    connection points on the left sides of the spare boats (you are\n    not allowed to use the right side), so that the geometric\n    ordering of the boats is not changed.\nGiven this situation, how can you use the boats so that the\n    number of designs that end up sunk is minimized? Note that we\n    want your program to be able to handle non-planar\n    configurations as well, in case the students ever turn to air\n    balloons.

A single strand of DNA consists of many genes,\n    which fall into different categories called gene\n    types. Gene types are delimited by specific nucleotide\n    sequences known as gene markers. Each gene type\n    $i$ has a unique start\n    marker $\\mathtt{s}_ i$ and\n    a unique end marker $\\mathtt{e}_\n    i$. After many dirty jobs (growing bacteria, cell\n    extraction, protein engineering, and so on), your research\n    group can convert DNA into a form consisting of only the gene\n    markers, removing all the genetic material lying between the\n    markers.\nYour research group came up with the interesting hypothesis\n    that gene interpretation depends on whether the markers of some\n    gene types form properly nested structures. To decide whether\n    markers of gene type $i$\n    form a proper nesting in a given sequence of markers\n    $w$, one needs to consider\n    the subsequence of $w$\n    containing only the markers of gene type $i$ ($\\mathtt{s}_ i$ and $\\mathtt{e}_ i$), leaving none of them\n    out.

Whether a gene type $i$ forms a proper nesting now also\n    depends on where the circular DNA is cut.

Mech units are gigantic bipedal robots,\n    usually piloted by Japanese teenagers, that carry weapons of\n    superior destruction. The weapons are so powerful that one hit\n    should neutralize the Godzilla threat.\nThe SDMF faces two challenges. First, the mech units are so\n    big that they cannot walk over any residential sectors, as they\n    would then trample the people of Tokyo. Second, the weapons of\n    the mech units are so powerful that the pilots cannot afford to\n    fire them at Godzilla while there are any residential sectors\n    between the firing mech and Godzilla.\nThe SDMF wants to run some simulations before it faces the\n    Godzilla threat. The simulations are based on a two-dimensional\n    map of the area of Tokyo where Godzilla is running amock. The\n    passing of time happens between rounds, where in each round\n    there are two turns. In the first turn, Godzilla gets to do a\n    move. In the second turn, the mech units are allowed a move. In\n    a single move, Godzilla moves one sector on the map in the\n    directions North, East, South or West.\nGodzilla is lacking in brain matter and has a very\n    predictable movement scheme. First, Godzilla does not move into\n    a sector that he already visited. Each round, on the first\n    turn:\nIt looks for any houses to destroy that are adjacent to\n        him. If the sector adjacent to him is a residential sector,\n        it will move to that sector and destroy the sector. When a\n        residential sector is destroyed, it becomes a ruined\n        sector instead. Godzilla looks around him in the order\n        North, East, South, West. So, it will first look to the\n        North to see whether there is a residential sector. If so,\n        it will move there. Otherwise, he will look East to see if\n        there is a residential sector to destroy, and so on.\nIn the event that there are no residential sectors\n        adjacent to Godzilla, he will try to move North. If that\n        move would move him outside the map or into a sector he\n        already visited, he will instead try to move East. If he\n        cannot move East, he will move South. In the case that he\n        cannot move South, he will try to move West instead. The\n        terrifying presence of a mech will not stop Godzilla from\n        moving into the sector that is occupied by a mech unit. In\n        that case, Godzilla is considered to be in range of the\n        mech unit\u2019s weapons of superior destruction, in the next\n        turn.\nIf Godzilla has no move options left, he will instead\n        start roaring and wail his arms, inflicting no damage to\n        Tokyo city.\nEach round, on the second turn, each mech unit can either\n    stay at its position, or move to an adjacent non-residential\n    sector, or a ruined sector. It cannot move outside the map.\n    When moving, a mech unit moves one sector in one of the\n    directions North, East, South or West. It is allowed to move\n    into the space of another mech unit. At the moment that a mech\n    unit is able to fire its weapons at Godzilla, it will do so on\n    the mech units\u2019 turn.

{"title": "Shortest Flight Path", "description": "Commercial flights are statistically quite safe (in terms of\n    number of deaths per passenger-kilometer, only going to the\n    moon is safer). But there are still reasons for precautions and\n    safety regulations. An early such rule was the so-called\n    \u201c60-minute rule,\u201d which required that a two-engine plane must\n    always be within 60 minutes of the nearest adequate airport\n    along its entire flight path. A variety of similar rules have\n    existed, but at their core, they remain the same: the flight\n    path can not take the airplane more than a certain maximum\n    allowed distance from the nearest airport. With these\n    restrictions, planes cannot always use a direct route for\n    flying from one airport to another.\nIn this problem we will compute the shortest flight path\n    between two airports while adhering to a maximum allowed\n    distance rule. In the figure below, which illustrates the first\n    sample test case, any flight route has to stay within the three\n    circles. Thus a plane going from airport 2 to airport 3 has to\n    detour from the direct route via the region around airport 1.\n    Note that the plane would not necessarily have to go to airport\n    1 itself.\nThings are further complicated by the fact that planes have\n    limited fuel supply, and to go longer distances they may need\n    to make a stopover at intermediate airports. Thus, depending on\n    the fuel capacity, a plane going from airport 2 to airport 3 in\n    the figure might have to stop over at airport 1 (or the fuel\n    capacity might be too low even to go to airport 1, in which\n    case the trip would be impossible to make).\nWe make the following simplifying assumptions:\nThe surface of the earth is a sphere of radius 6370\n        km.\nBoth time and fuel consumption are directly proportional\n        to distance traveled. In other words we are interested only\n        in total distance traveled.\nThe difference in distance caused by planes flying at\n        different altitudes is negligible.

{"title": "Word Cloud", "description": "A word cloud (or tag cloud) is a visual representation of\n    textual data based on a weighted metric. In the above cloud\n    (which is based on this year\u2019s list of Mid-Central teams), the\n    font size of each word is based on its number of occurrences in\n    the data set. Tagg Johnson is a man obsessed with counting\n    words that appear in online documents. On his computer, he\n    keeps a spreadsheet of all the sites he visits, along with a\n    list of words that appear on each site and the number of times\n    such word appears. Tagg would like to generate word clouds\n    based on the data he has collected.\nBefore describing the algorithm Tagg uses for generating\n    clouds, we digress for a quick lesson in typography. The basic\n    unit of measure is known as a point (typically abbreviated as\n    pt). A font\u2019s size is described based on the vertical\n    number of points from one line to the next, including any\n    interline spacing. For example, with a 12pt font, the vertical\n    space from the top of one character to the top of a character\n    below it is 12 points. We assume that a character\u2019s height is\n    precisely equal to the font\u2019s point size (regardless of whether\n    the character is upper or lower case).\nFor this problem, we focus on a fixed-width font, such as\n    Courier, in which each character of the alphabet is also given\n    the same amount of width. The character width for such a font\n    depends on the font size and the aspect ratio. For Courier, a\n    word with $t$ characters\n    rendered in a font of size $P$ has a total width of $\\left\\lceil \\frac{9}{16} \\cdot t \\cdot P\n    \\right\\rceil $ when measured in points. Note well the\n    use of the ceiling operator, which converts any noninteger to\n    the next highest integer. For example, a 5-letter word in a\n    20pt font would be rendered with a height of 20 points and a\n    width equal to $\\left\\lceil\n    \\frac{900}{16} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 56.25\\right\\rceil\n    =57$ points.\nNow we can describe Tagg\u2019s algorithm for creating a word\n    cloud. He pre-sorts his word list into alphabetical order and\n    removes words that do not occur at least five times.

The\n    Manhattan distance (or taxicab distance)\n    between two points, $p_1 = (x_1,\n    y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2,\n    y_2)$, is given by\n(here we assume integer coordinates, although Manhattan\n    distance can also be applied more generally). This captures the\n    idea that the shortest distance between two intersections in\n    Manhattan (for a vehicle like a car or truck that is restricted\n    to travelling along streets and avenues) is the sum of the\n    differences between the street numbers and the avenue numbers\n    (in absolute value for each).\nBut this simple model ignores one of the most famous\n    features of Manhattan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Broadway! Known as a\n    global center for live theater, especially musical theater,\n    Broadway (which is a road) is also significant because, in a\n    certain part of Manhattan, it cuts at an angle across the\n    regular grid of streets and avenues. If a vehicle can travel\n    along Broadway for at least part of its journey, this\n    potentially reduces the shortest distance between its starting\n    point and its destination relative to a trip along only streets\n    and avenues.\nWe will model Broadway by adding a single non-vertical and\n    non-horizontal line segment to the grid described above. This\n    line segment has endpoints with integer coordinates,\n    $(\\mathit{bx}_1,\n    \\mathit{by}_1)$ and $(\\mathit{bx}_2, \\mathit{by}_2)$, and\n    each point where it intersects a vertical or horizontal grid\n    line creates a new intersection (unless one exists there\n    already).\nNow what is the shortest distance from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$ for a vehicle that can\n    travel along any street or avenue, and can also travel along\n    Broadway?

Their\n    new effort is a password system used to hide a password inside\n    another string of characters we denote as a message.\n    However, it is important that the message has a certain\n    property relative to the hidden password.\nLet us assume that we denote the characters of the password\n    as $ c_1 c_2 \\ldots c_ P$\n    (although those characters need not be distinct). To be a valid\n    message for the password, if you start from the beginning of\n    the message and search for any character from the set\n    $\\{ c_1, \\ldots , c_ P \\}\n    $, it must be that $c_1$ is the first that you find.\n    Subsequently, if you continue looking from that point of the\n    message for any character from the set $\\{ c_2, \\ldots , c_ P \\} $, it must\n    be that $c_2$ is the next\n    that you find. Continuing in that manner, $c_3$ must be the next character from\n    the set $\\{ c_3, \\ldots , c_ P\\}\n    $, and so on until reaching $c_ P$.\nFor example, if the password is ABC,\n    then the string HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY is a valid message.\nNotice that A is the first of the\n        set $\\{ $A,\n        B, C$\\} $ to appear in the\n        message.

For this\n    password, the string SOMECHORESARETOUGH is a valid message.

{"title": "Venn Intervals", "description": "A Venn interval diagram is a graphical way to\n    illustrate intersections of sets in 1D, similar to the more\n    familiar Venn diagrams in 2D. A Venn interval diagram is\n    defined by assigning a non-zero-length integer interval\n    $[l_ i, u_ i)$ to each set\n    $S_ i$. The\n    regions where different intervals overlap correspond\n    to intersections of different combinations of the sets (see\n    Figure\u00a01).\nMore formally, given the interval assigned to each set, you\n    can compute the regions that appear in the Venn interval\n    diagram with the following algorithm:\nCombine together all of the interval starting points\n        $l_ i$ and ending\n        points $u_ i$ into a\n        single set, and sort them to get an integer sequence\n        $p_1 < p_2 < \\cdots\n        < p_ m$.\nLabel each interval $(p_\n        j, p_{j+1})$ spanning consecutive $p$ values with all the sets\n        $S_ i$ for which\n        $(p_ j, p_{j+1})$ is\n        contained within $[l_ i, u_\n        i)$. (Note that partial overlaps are not possible:\n        the $p$-interval is\n        either contained within, or disjoint from, each\n        set-interval).\nThe set of all non-empty labels are the regions\n        of the Venn interval diagram. Each label $\\{ S_ a, S_ b, \\ldots \\} $\n        represents an intersection of sets $S_ a \\cap S_ b \\cap \\cdots .$\nIn the example Venn interval diagram shown above, there are\n    six sets ($A$ through\n    $F$) and nine regions\n    ($B$, $A \\cap B$, $A$, $A\\cap C$, $A \\cap C \\cap D$, $C \\cap D$, $D$, $E$, and $F$). This example Venn interval\n    diagram has a \u201chole\u201d where no sets overlap (between the end of\n    region $D$ and the start\n    of $E$); this is allowed.\n    Note also that $E\\cap F$\n    is not a region: $E$ and $F$\u2019s intervals touch at their\n    endpoints, but the two do not overlap on a $p$-interval.\nNot every list of regions has a corresponding illustration\n    as a Venn interval diagram. Consider for example the regions\n    $A\\cap B$, $B \\cap C$, and $C\\cap A$. There is no way to lay out\n    intervals for $A$,\n    $B$, and $C$ on the real line to form exactly\n    these three regions (any Venn interval diagram that includes\n    these three regions must also include $A \\cap B \\cap C$). In addition, a\n    Venn interval diagram is degenerate if any interval is\n    contained within another interval: if $l_ i \\leq l_ j$ and $u_ j \\leq u_ i$ for some $i\\neq j$. For example, if\n    $C$\u2019s right endpoint were\n    at $4$ instead of\n    $5$, the Venn interval\n    diagram in Figure\u00a01 would become degenerate, since the\n    interval assigned to the set $C$ would then be contained within\n    $A$\u2019s interval\n    (corresponding to Sample Input 3).\nGiven a list of regions, construct a non-degenerate Venn interval diagram containing\n    exactly those regions, if possible.\n", "input_description": "The first line of the input contains a single integer\n    $n$, the number of regions\n    required in your diagram $(1 \\leq\n    n \\leq 4\\, 000).$ The next $n$ lines each describe one region.\n    Each line begins with an integer $k$, the number of sets that intersect\n    to form the region $(1 \\leq k\n    \\leq 2\\, 000)$, followed by $k$ space-separated set names.

The second level contains $4$ glasses touching in a square\n    pattern centered above the first level, and the third level\n    contains $1$ glass\n    centered above the other levels. Figure 1 shows a a top-down\n    view of this tower.\nChampagne is always poured directly into the top glass. In\n    this example, once the top glass fills and starts to overflow,\n    it immediately begins filling the $4$ glasses below (i.e., assume\n    overflowing champagne travels instantaneously to any glasses\n    below). Once the $4$\n    glasses on the second level fill, they begin overflowing to the\n    $9$ on the bottom level.\n    Note that in this example the $4$ on the second level finish filling\n    at the same time, but the $9$ on the lowest level finish filling\n    at different times. This means that there will be some amount\n    of spilled champagne before the tower has finished filling \u2013\n    this is an acceptable price to pay for such a beautiful\n    sight.\nThe new fad is to make interesting patterns or imagery out\n    of champagne glasses.

On a wall, there is a row of $k$ pyramid-shaped stone slabs. Each\n    stone features three hieroglyphs: an ankh (top), an eye of\n    Horus (bottom left), and an ibis (bottom right).\nNext to the wall there are $n$ levers. Cautiously experimenting\n    with these, wary of potential traps, the professor realizes\n    that each lever rotates some of the pyramids clockwise or\n    counter-clockwise so that another hieroglyph is pointing\n    upwards on them.

For instance, once she eats\n    a piece of apple immediately followed by a piece of banana, she\n    expects to have a leaf of mint immediately followed by\n    chocolate in the remaining part of the kabob. She is happy if\n    she finds this mint-chocolate pattern anywhere in the remaining\n    kabob pieces.\nHere is a kabob that Anna likes:\nor, graphically:\nAnna has written down her perfect set of kabob patterns for\n    the new restaurant, but she worries that these rules would give\n    too many potential kabob types. This set of patterns is written\n    down as a ruleset, where each rule is of the form\n    \u201c$b$ implies $e$ afterwards\u201d, where $b$ and $e$ are non-empty sequences of\n    characters, representing food pieces. A rule of the form\n    $b\\, \\texttt{>}\\, e$\n    with $b=b_1 \\ldots b_ k$\n    and $e=e_1 \\ldots e_ l$\n    means that, if the pattern $b$ is encountered in the kabob, then\n    the kabob should also contain $e$ at some point after. Each\n    $b_{i+1}$ must immediately\n    follow $b_ i$ to trigger\n    the rule and similarly each $e_{j+1}$ must immediately follow\n    $e_ j$ to satisfy it, but\n    $b_ k$ and $e_1$ do not need to be consecutive.\n    No food piece can appear more than once in a rule (i.e., there\n    is no $i,j$ such that\n    $e_ j=b_ i$ and no\n    $i\\neq j$ with\n    $b_ i=b_ j$ or\n    $e_ i=e_ j$) but a food\n    piece can appear in several rules.\nNote that if there are several occurrences of the word\n    $b$ in a kabob, they all\n    need to be followed by an $e$. This can be a single $e$, as long as this $e$ appears after all the $b$.\nIn a ruleset, rules are separated by \u2018|\u2019 and are of the form $u\\, \\texttt{>}\\, v$ meaning that\n    each pattern $u$ implies a\n    pattern $v$ afterwards.\n    $u$ and $v$ are words composed of\n    alphanumerical characters and no character can appear twice in\n    a rule. For instance, the ruleset \u201cAB>X|R>A|T>B\u201d describes three\n    rules:\nfor each AB there must be an\n        X afterwards;\nfor each R there must be an\n        A afterwards; and\nfor each T there must be a\n        B afterwards.\nUsing this ruleset, the kabobs SBSB, REA, ABX, BA, ABXBA, RRA,\n    TBTB, and RTABX are valid; but RAT, TAB, and\n    ABXAB are not.\nAnna asks you how many kabobs of a given size are compatible\n    with her ruleset.\n", "input_description": "", "output_description": "", "problem_class": "Hard", "problem_score": 2.1}

{"title": "Wormhole Extreme!!!", "description": "Brad and Joseph are planning a new science fiction series\n    called Wormhole Extreme!!! where explorers\n    journey about the galaxy by traversing wormholes. As with many\n    science fiction series, the laws of physics are given a\n    creative reinterpretation for the purpose of entertainment.\nA wormhole can be thought of as a straight line\n        connecting its two openings. The ship travels along this\n        line while it is in the wormhole.\nThe explorers enter the wormhole with some initial\n        velocity and then the spacecraft is ballistic: the\n        spacecraft\u2019s controls are inoperable while flying in the\n        wormhole. But some unknown wormhole force affects\n        the spacecraft\u2019s velocity while in the wormhole.\nMore precisely, the wormhole can be thought of as\n    consecutive intervals where interval $i$ has length $\\ell _ i$ wormhole units\n    ($\\omega $). While the\n    spacecraft is travelling along interval $i$, its acceleration is $a_ i$ wormhole units per second\n    squared ($\\omega / s^2$).\n    So velocities are simply scalar values indicating the speed in\n    which the ship is approaching the exit. Negative velocities\n    indicate the ship is actually flying back towards the entrance.\n    When the ship transitions from one interval to the next, its\n    velocity is preserved during this transition. Note,\n    $a_ i$ could be either\n    positive (the ship accelerates in this segment) or negative\n    (the ship decelerates in this segment) but wormhole physics\n    dictate it will never be zero.\nThe crew needs to enter the wormhole with a large enough\n    initial velocity or else they could get pushed back to the\n    entrance. To increase tension, Brad and Joseph want to\n    calculate the minimum possible nonnegative velocity\n    $v$ such that if the\n    spacecraft has velocity $v$ at the entrance of the wormhole,\n    then it will reach the exit. Given this velocity, they also\n    want to know how long it will take the spacecraft to reach the\n    exit.\nClarifications:\nIf the spacecraft reaches the start of an interval\n        $i$ the moment its\n        velocity becomes 0 and if $a_\n        i > 0$, the spacecraft immediately begins to\n        accelerate and its journey continues.\nThis also applies to the initial segment $i = 1$: a spacecraft with\n        velocity $0$ at the\n        entrance will immediately start journeying through the\n        wormhole if $a_1 >\n        0$.\nSimilarly, if the spacecraft reaches the exit the moment\n        its velocity reaches $0$, it successfully exits the\n        wormhole because the crew can resume operation of the\n        craft.\n", "input_description": "Input begins with a single integer $N$ ($1\n    \\leq N \\leq 100\\, 000$).

{"title": "Bike Gears", "description": "Many multi-gear (multi-speed) bicycles have a drivetrain\n    mechanism that is structured as follows: the pedals are\n    attached to a front set of sprockets (toothed wheels), which is\n    connected by a chain to a back set of sprockets, which in turn\n    is attached to the rear wheel. The chain can shift, under the\n    cyclist\u2019s control, to any one of the front sprockets and to any\n    one of the back sprockets (sometimes there are mechanical\n    limitations that preclude certain front-back combinations, but\n    we don\u2019t have to worry about that here). As the cyclist moves\n    the pedals forward, the force is transferred from the pedals to\n    the selected front sprocket, to the chain, to the selected back\n    sprocket, and finally to the rear wheel; it is the motion of\n    the rear wheel that drives the bike forward.\nThe gear the bike is in at any point in time is\n    given by the ordered pair $(f,b)$, where $f$ is the number of teeth on the\n    currently selected front sprocket, and $b$ is the number of teeth on the\n    currently selected back sprocket. The ratio $f/b$ is used to compare gears. A\n    higher (respectively, lower) ratio corresponds to a higher\n    (respectively, lower) gear. Therefore, for example, to change\n    into a lower gear, the cyclist can shift the chain either onto\n    a smaller front sprocket or onto a larger back sprocket (or\n    both). Most cyclists change gears easily and intuitively in\n    response to variations in terrain. However, for bicycles with a\n    relatively large number of gears, figuring out how to progress\n    through the gears in order from lowest to highest can\n    be surprisingly non-obvious, and in fact most cyclists likely\n    do not know how to do this.\nGiven information about the front and back sprockets on a\n    bicycle with the drivetrain structure described above, your\n    task is to determine the exact sequence of $(f,b)$ sprocket pairs that a cyclist\n    would need to select to progress, in order, through all the\n    gears from lowest to highest.

{"title": "Ekki minn forseti", "description": "In Iceland it is impossible for a candidate with a lower\n    amount of votes to win against the candidate with the most\n    votes. Even though our electoral system is not susceptible to\n    this flaw in particular, it is hardly perfect. In Iceland\u2019s\n    electoral system, a voter simply chooses a single candidate to\n    vote for and the candidate with the highest number of votes\n    wins.\n\u00d3lafur \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur Har\u00f0arson, a professor of political science at\n    the University of Iceland, has criticized Iceland\u2019s electoral\n    system for decades. In an old article, he wrote about one flaw\n    in particular. He examined the possibility of an almost even\n    distribution of votes between candidates. With two candidates,\n    the winner would have to receive just over half of the votes in\n    order to win, which makes the system seem as fair as it\n    possibly can be. However, if there are ten candidates in the\n    race, then it may be sufficient to receive just over\n    $10\\% $ of the votes to be\n    elected. Since the voters\u2019 first choice is the only thing that\n    is taken into account, up to $90\\% $ of the nation may be left with\n    the candidate which they like the least as president.\nAnother flaw of the system, which is often criticized, is\n    known as lost votes. It is often clear by the polls before the\n    election, which two candidates are most likely to win. The\n    difference between them and the third, fourth or even ninth\n    place candidates can be so large that the poll clearly shows\n    which candidates will be in the top two places. A voter may\n    then feel their vote is lost since their vote will not impact\n    the battle between the top two candidates. Some voters may even\n    choose to vote for the candidate in the top two which the like\n    the most, even though, in their mind, they may be voting for\n    the lesser of two evils.\nOne solution to this issue would be to have multiple rounds\n    of the electoral process so ensure each vote has an impact, but\n    for a small nationm like Iceland this can prove financially\n    unviable. Luckily, a system exists which only requires one\n    round and is free of the aforementioned flaws. The system is\n    based on the voter ordering the candidates by their preference.\n    The main flaw of this system then is that the voting process\n    becomes a little more complicated for the voter. The first\n    choice of each voter would then determine the initial result of\n    the elections, which would be the same result as we obtain in\n    the current system. The difference is that while no voter has a\n    majority of the votes, the candidate with the lowest amount of\n    votes is removed from the election. The votes for that\n    candidate are then updated, and each voter\u2019s next option\n    receives the vote. When some candidate has a majority of the\n    votes, the winner of the election has been determined.\nThe Competitive Programming Association of Iceland used\n    their time machine to travel back to previous elections, asking\n    every person in the country how they would vote in this new\n    system. The association travelled back in time slowly, but\n    surely, and everything went fine and dandy. Each voter provided\n    an ordered list with all candidates listed. When it was time to\n    travel back to the future, to the year $2023$, it was revealed that the time\n    machine did not work in both directions. The members of the\n    association were therefore stuck in the year $1952$, when there were not many\n    computers to be found in Iceland. Therefore, they were unable\n    to write a program to simulate the elections with the new\n    votes. They decided to freeze themselves in order to reach the\n    year $2023$ once more and\n    Arnar left these instructions in the hope that someone would\n    implement the program for him.\n", "input_description": "The first line of the input consists of two integers\n    $n$, the number of votes,\n    and $m$, the number of\n    candidates, which are separated by a space.", "output_description": "Output a single line with the name of the winner of the\n    elections.", "problem_class": "Hard", "problem_score": 3.3}

{"title": "Ternarian Weights", "description": "Back in the Hellenic era, there was a small island in the\n    Mediterranean Sea known as Ternaria. It was close to Sparta,\n    but because of its mountainous terrain the Spartans found it\n    difficult to conquer and it remained an independent state until\n    the great earthquake of 729BC when it sank beneath the sea. It\n    had a remarkable civilization and some modern historians think\n    it is the basis for the mythological city of Atlantis. Ternaria\n    is still known for its fundamental contributions to science and\n    mathematics, many of which were adopted by the Greeks and later\n    by the Romans. For example, Ternarians were the first group to\n    use the standard weight of pounds, which we still use today.\n    Ternarian mathematics used base 3 for all its calculations.\n    (Historians speculate that this was out of respect for King\n    Ternary who lost two fingers on each hand while battling the\n    Spartans.)\nTernarian trade scales were a standard for many centuries.\n    They were known for their accuracy and ease of use. They were\n    the first to construct a scale with weighing pans on each side\n    and a fulcrum in the middle. The object to be weighed was\n    placed on the left side of the scale and weights were placed on\n    both sides, until balance was obtained. This sounds strange by\n    modern standards, because typically on modern scales we would\n    only place weights on the right side. However, the modern\n    method requires additional weights. The Ternarian method only\n    requires one weight for each power of three pounds, e.g. one\n    weight of 1 pound, one weight of 3 pounds, one weight of 9\n    pounds, etc.\nSay you are weighing a 2-pound Ternarian hen (known for\n    their succulent white meat). You place the hen on the left\n    side. Place the 3-pound weight on the right side. This is too\n    heavy, so you place the 1-pound weight with the hen on the left\n    side to achieve balance. Note that the sum of the weights on\n    the right side minus the sum of the weights on the left side\n    equals the weight of the object.\nAs another example, consider weighing a 21-pound Ternarian\n    squash. Using the Ternarian system, you would place weights of\n    27 pounds and 3 pounds in the right pan and a weight of 9\n    pounds in the left pan (along with the object) again achieving\n    balance.\nWrite a program that accepts as input the weight of an\n    object in base 10 and outputs the weights to be placed in both\n    pans.\n", "input_description": "The first line contains an integer $1 \\leq n \\leq 100$, indicating how\n    many test cases are to be solved.

The total length of the shoelace that is\n    used for lacing is the length used between the eyelets plus\n    $t$ for each eyelet the\n    shoelace passes through.

Otherwise, $n$ fails the Luhn\n        checksum test.\nFor example, consider the number $n = 1234567890123411$ from Sample\n    Input\u00a01. The first row of Figure\u00a01 gives the original\n    digits of $n$, and the\n    second row contains the digits of $n$ after the transformation step,\n    with transformed digits shown in bold.

Therefore, if you\n    start with one pair of newborn porpoises, at the end of the 1st\n    year, you would still have one pair of porpoises (now mature\n    and ready to procreate). At the end of the second year, you\n    would have a nice new pod of newborns. But you would also have\n    a pair of mature adults! Next year, they would have a second\n    pod of newborns, but their $1^{\\text {st}}$ pod would be ready to\n    start producing pods of their own.\nEach year, all the porpoises that were around last year are\n    still there.

Naturally, superheroes\n    need to respond to crises immediately, so Robin asked you for\n    help in figuring out how to get around your hometown\n    quickly.\nYour hometown is built on a square grid, where each block is\n    $w \\times w$ meters. Each\n    block is filled by a single building. The buildings may have\n    different heights (see Figure\u00a01). To get from one building\n    to another (not necessarily adjacent) building, Robin makes a\n    single jump from the center of the roof of the first building\n    to the center of the roof of the second building. Robin cannot\n    change direction while in the air, but can choose the angle at\n    which to lift off.\nOf course, Robin only wants to perform jumps without\n    colliding with any buildings. Such collisions do little damage\n    to a superhero, but building owners tend to get irritated when\n    someone crashes through their windows. You explain the physics\n    to Robin: \u201cAll your jumps are done with the same initial\n    velocity $v$, which has a\n    horizontal component $v_\n    d$ towards the destination and vertical component\n    $v_ h$ upwards, so\n    $v_ d^2 + v_ h^2 = v^2$.\n    As you travel, your horizontal velocity stays constant\n    ($v_ d(t) = v_ d$), but\n    your vertical velocity is affected by gravity ($v_ h(t) = v_ h - t \\cdot g$), where\n    $g = 9.80665 \\text { m}/\\text\n    {s}^2$ in your hometown.

{"title": "Statues", "description": "Central City is best known for its famous Statue Park.

The Park Statue Keeper is Milo D. Venus\n    and he wants to move some of the statues so that visitors on\n    two of these paths can see all of the statues. He realizes that\n    one way to do this is to pick a corner of the park and then\n    start placing the statues along the diagonals of the grid in\n    order of the diagonals\u2019 distance from the selected corner,\n    skipping over any water feature squares. The smallest statue\n    would be placed in the first diagonal (assuming there is no\n    water feature there). The next smallest statues will be placed\n    in the second diagonal (this could be $0$, $1$ or $2$ statues depending on the number of\n    water feature squares in the diagonal). The next smallest\n    statues are placed in the third diagonal, and so on. With this\n    scheme though there are a lot of choices to make. For example,\n    if you wanted the best viewing to be along roads N and W, you\n    would use the diagonals in Figure 1b placing the smallest\n    statue in diagonal $a$,\n    the next smallest in diagonal $b$, the next three smallest in\n    diagonal $c$, the next two\n    smallest in diagonal $d$,\n    and so on.

Within any diagonal\n    which can fit more than two statues the placement of those\n    statues can be in any order, leading to even more choices.\nGiven all this flexibility it seems natural to pick the\n    scheme that minimizes the number of statues that need to be\n    moved, but which scheme is best is not immediately clear.

{"title": "String Factoring", "description": "Spotting patterns in seemingly random strings is a problem\n    with many applications. E.g., in our efforts to understand the\n    genome we investigate the structure of DNA strings. In data\n    compression we are interested in finding repetitions, so the\n    data can be represented more efficiently with pointers. Another\n    plausible example arises from the area of artificial\n    intelligence, as how to interpret information given to you in a\n    language you do not know. The natural thing to do in order to\n    decode the information message would be to look for repetitions\n    in it. So if the SETI project (the Search for Extra Terrestrial\n    Intelligence) ever get a signal in the H21-spectra, we need to\n    know how to decompose it.\nOne way of capturing the redundancy of a string is to find\n    its factoring. If two or more identical substrings $A$ follow each other in a string\n    $S$, we can represent this\n    aprt of $S$ as the\n    substring $A$, enclosed by\n    parentheses, raised to the power of the number of repetitions.\n    E.g., the string $DOODOO$\n    can be factored as $(DOO)^2$, but also as $(D(O)^2)^2$. Naturally, the latter\n    factoring is considered better since it cannot be factored any\n    further. We say that a factoring is irreducible if it does not\n    contain any consecutive repetition of a substring. A string may\n    have several irreducible factorings, as seen by the example\n    string $POPPOP$. It can be\n    factored as $(POP)^2$, as\n    well as $PO(P)^2OP$. The\n    first factoring has a shorter representation and motivates the\n    following definition. The weigh of a factoring equals\n    the number of characters in it, excluding the\n    parentheses and the exponents. Thus the weight of $(POP)^2$ is $3$, whereas $PO(P)^2OP$ has weight $5$. A maximal facotring is a\n    factoring with the smallest possible weight. It should be clear\n    that a maximal factoring is always an irreducible one, but\n    there may still be several maximal factorings.

Following the label is a single space and one of the\n    following commands (with explanations following):\nLET X = <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT>\n        Assign the result of the arithmetic statement to variable\n        X.\nIF <CONDITION> THEN GOTO L\n        If the boolean given is true, then go to the statement\n        labeled L, where L is a valid label. (If\n        the condition is not true, continue execution to the\n        statement with the next lowest label.)\nPRINT <PRINT_STATEMENT>\n        Produce output, without an appended newline.\nPRINTLN <PRINT_STATEMENT>\n        Produce output, with an appended newline.\nHere are details on types, variables, and the terms\n    <ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT>,\n    <CONDITION>, and\n    <PRINT_STATEMENT> used above.\nAll numeric values (in the input and for the variable\n        representation) are signed 32-bit integers.\nAll variables are single uppercase characters\n        (A through Z). They are all global in\n        scope, and are all initialized to zero before program\n        execution begins.\n<ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT> is one of the\n        following: X, X + Y, X - Y,\n        X * Y, or X / Y. Here, X and\n        Y each indicate either a variable or an\n        integer.\n<CONDITION> is one of the following:\n        X = Y, X > Y, X < Y, X\n        <> Y, X <= Y, or X >= Y.\n        Again, X and Y each indicate either a\n        variable or an integer. Here, <> indicates\n        inequality.\n<PRINT_STATEMENT> is either a variable\n        name or a literal string delimited by double quotes. Inside\n        the quotes, the string contains only alphanumeric\n        characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and spaces.\nIn the signed 32-bit arithmetic, the usual rules of\n    truncation towards zero (for division) and overflow (for\n    addition and multiplication) and underflow (for subtraction)\n    apply. The following examples illustrate these conditions:\nFurther, division by zero will not occur.\nProgram execution begins with the statement having the\n    smallest label, and proceeds with the statement having the next\n    smallest label. (Unless a GOTO executes, in which case\n    execution proceeds at the designated label.) The program halts\n    after it has completed the statement with the largest label\n    (which is guaranteed not to contain a GOTO).\n", "input_description": "Input consists of a single program.

A genetic sequence\n    is a sequence of nucleotides, which in this problem is\n    represented by a string containing only the letters A, C, G, and T in some\n    combination, each letter representing a single nucleotide\n    (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and\n    Thymine, respectively).\nOne of the key discoveries made by ICPC is that through a\n    process called Genetically Optimized Organic Folding (GOOF),\n    they can take a genetic sequence and transform it into a\n    simpler one, while preserving many of the properties of the\n    sequence that ICPC wants to analyze.\nA single application of GOOF works as follows. Find a point\n    between two adjacent nucleotides in the nucleotide sequence,\n    such that the sequence reads the same from that point in both\n    directions, up until the nearer end of the sequence. For\n    instance, in the sequence ATTACC,\n    there are two such points: AT-TACC\n    and ATTAC-C. Then pick one of these\n    points (say, the first one), and fold the genetic sequence at\n    that point, merging the identical nucleotides (so, in this case\n    the AT and TA would become merged, and the resulting\n    sequence would be CCAT or TACC).\nThrough repeated application of GOOF, a nucleotide can\n    potentially be made much shorter. However, manually searching\n    for the appropriate folding points is very time-consuming. ICPC\n    reached out to you to write a program that would automate the\n    process of finding the folding points and choosing them so as\n    to obtain the shortest possible genetic sequence from a given\n    input sequence.\n", "input_description": "The input contains a single string $s$ representing the nucleotide\n    sequence to be analyzed.

{"title": "Alea iacta est", "description": "Isaac B. Manfred always dreamed about being a terribly rich\n    man. Recently, he started to study dice games. He found several\n    of them similar to a trademarked game called Yahtzee! The rules\n    sometimes vary but basic principles are the same. To give you\n    an idea, we will describe a simplified version of such\n    rules.\nThe game consists of rounds. In each round, a player rolls\n    five dice. After the first roll, it is possible to keep some of\n    the dice and re-roll the rest of them. Any number of dice can\n    be rerolled (including none or all of them). If the re-rolled\n    dice still do not fit the player\u2019s intentions, it is possible\n    to re-roll some of them again, for the third and final time.\n    After at most two such re-rolls, the player must assign the\n    result to one of possible combinations and the round is scored\n    according to that combination.\nCombination\nCondition\nScoring\nExample\nScore\nOnes\nAt least one 1.\nOne point for each 1.\n1 1 2 4 5\n2\nTwos\nAt least one 2.\nTwo points for each 2.\n1 2 2 2 6\n6\nThrees\nAt least one 3.\nThree points for each 3.\n1 2 4 5 5\n0\nFours\nAt least one 4.\nFour points for each 4.\n4 4 4 4 4\n20\nFives\nAt least one 5.\nFive points for each 5.\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\nSixes\nAt least one 6.\nSix points for each 6.\n1 4 6 6 6\n18\nSequence\n(1 2 3 4 5) or (2 3 4 5 6).\nThirty points.\n1 2 3 4 5\n30\nFull House\nThree of the same value and\nSum of all dice values.\n2 2 5 5 5\n19\na pair of another value.\nFour of a kind\nFour of the same value,\nSum of all dice values.\n4 4 4 4 5\n21\nthe fifth one different.\nFive of a kind\nAll five of the same value.\nFifty points.\n1 1 1 1 1\n50\nChance\nNone.\nSum of all dice values.\n2 4 5 5 6\n22\nA small example: The player rolls 2, 3, 6, 6, 5. The two 6\u2019s\n    are kept and the three remaining dice re-rolled, they give new\n    values: 1, 1, 6. The player may now choose to score 20 points\n    immediately for a Full House. Instead, he or she decides to\n    re-roll the two 1\u2019s again, in hope there will be another 6. The\n    dice give 4 and 5 and the player will score either 18 points\n    for Sixes or 27 points for Chance.\nThe main point of the game is that there are eleven\n    combinations and eleven rounds. During the whole game, each\n    combination must be used exactly once. It may happen that some\n    result would not fit into any available combination. In such a\n    case, the player must select some combination anyway, scoring\n    zero points for that round and losing the possibility to use\n    that combination later. These rules make the game very tricky,\n    especially at the end, when the combinations have been almost\n    exhausted.\nNow, we get back to Isaac. He found a casino with an\n    electronic version of this dice game. After carefully watching\n    many games of other players, he was able to crack the\n    random-number generator used in the machine. Therefore, he is\n    able to predict the following rolls exactly. What an\n    opportunity! However, it is still not easy to find the optimal\n    strategy.

Your only problem is to figure out which part of\n    Nuremberg to move to.

She often brings some pegs with\n    her, which she nails in some strategic places in the rock wall,\n    so that less experienced climbers can use them for support.\n    Fiona can climb to anywhere in the wall, but hammering a peg\n    needs some balance, so she can only place a peg if she is\n    standing in currently placed pegs (or, of course, the floor).\n    She can remove a peg at any time and reuse it later. For each\n    wall she is planning to visit, she has a careful plan for how\n    to place and remove pegs in such a way that every strategic\n    point has a peg at some step.\nYesterday it was raining, so the rock will be wet and it can\n    be unsafe to remove pegs. Because of this, Fiona will only\n    remove a peg $p$ if she\n    can stand on the same pegs as when $p$ was placed. Alas Fiona\u2019s existing\n    plans do not take this new precaution into account, so Fiona\n    has to update her plans and she has asked you for help. She\n    would like not to carry too many extra pegs, so you promised to\n    find safe plans using at most $10$ times more pegs than her previous\n    plans were using.

{"title": "Gerrymandering", "description": "Electoral systems across the world can vary widely. In some\n    systems, such as winner-take-all, the winner is\n    determined by the plurality of votes\u2014the candidate that\n    receives the most votes wins, and the loser(s) do not get a\n    position.\nSuch elections can have \u201cwasted votes.\u201d Conceptually, a\n    wasted vote is a vote that did not affect the election outcome.\n    While the exact definition of a wasted vote varies, we\u2019ll adopt\n    the following definition: in an election with $V$ voters, every vote for a losing\n    candidate is wasted (these are called lost votes), and\n    every vote for a winning candidate beyond the strict majority\n    of $\\lfloor V/2\\rfloor +\n    1$ votes the candidate needs to win is wasted (these are\n    called excess votes). For this problem we\u2019ll consider\n    a two-party system (let\u2019s call the parties A and B) with\n    elections that always involve one candidate from each\n    party.\nLet\u2019s illustrate wasted votes with a simple example between\n    two candidates in a district. Suppose that the candidate for\n    party A receives $100$\n    votes and the candidate for party B receives $200$ votes. All $100$ votes for party A are wasted\n    (lost votes for A), and $49$ votes for party B are wasted\n    (excess votes for B). This is because B needs $151$ ($\\lfloor (100 + 200) / 2 \\rfloor + 1$)\n    votes to win (over A), so the remaining $49$ are wasted.\nPolitical scientists use wasted votes to compute the\n    efficiency gap, a single number that summarizes wasted\n    votes. Suppose we have a number of races in different\n    districts, where each district elects one person. Across all\n    districts there are $V$\n    total votes cast, with $w_\n    A$ total wasted votes for party A and $w_ B$ total wasted votes for party B.\n    Then the efficiency gap is:\nA low efficiency gap indicates that the elections are\n    competitive, and that the number of candidates elected from\n    each party is representative of the total voting share for each\n    party. When the efficiency gap is high, this can be an\n    indication of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering refers to\n    organizing voting districts in a way that favors a particular\n    political outcome. Two common ways of doing this are to \u201cpack\u201d\n    similar voters into districts, or \u201ccrack\u201d them across multiple\n    districts; both ways tend to diminish those voters\u2019 influence\n    in electing candidates they would like to win.\nIn an election, districts are made up of precincts. A\n    precinct is an indivisible group of voters. The votes for all\n    precincts in a district are added together to find the results\n    for that district. In this problem you are given a description\n    of a number of precincts: the party vote totals for each\n    precinct, and how those precincts have been grouped into\n    districts.

In this problem, the contents of the tree will be\n    ignored, and you will be asked about the effect the heuristic\n    has on the structure of the tree. A binary tree is either empty\n    or consists of a node with a left child and a right child,\n    where each of the children are also binary trees. No node has\n    more than one parent, and there are no cycles. In any non-empty\n    tree, there is exactly one node without a parent, which is\n    called the root of the tree.\nThe rotate-to-root heuristic takes effect when a node in the\n    tree, say $X$, is\n    accessed. While $X$ is not\n    the root of the tree, the following procedure is executed:\nIf $X$ is the left\n    child of its parent, a right tree rotation is performed. Let\n    $P$ be the parent of\n    $X$, let $A$ be $X$\u2019s left child, let $B$ be $X$\u2019s right child, and let\n    $C$ be the right child of\n    $P$.

{"title": "The Punctilious Cruciverbalist", "description": "A crossword puzzle consists of a grid of squares in which\n    intersecting words are placed, one letter per square. Some grid\n    squares are filled black indicating that no letter should go\n    there. Solvers are given clues for each word, and each clue is\n    identified by a starting clue number and either the word Across\n    (for horizontal words) or Down (for vertical words). Each\n    square that can start a word is given a clue number, starting\n    in the upper left and proceeding left-to-right, row-wise. A\n    square will contain an across-clue number if the square to its\n    left is either black or off the grid, and a square will contain\n    a down-clue number if the square above it is either black or\n    off the grid. See Figure 1 for a simple example.\nWill Longz is an avid crossword puzzle enthusiast and as\n    with most solvers, he first tries to solve clues where some of\n    the letters are already present (from already solved clues\n    whose answers intersect the clue he is working on). Typically,\n    the closer to the beginning of the word that these letters are,\n    the better. Will has developed a metric to help him decide the\n    order in which he should solve clues. If the answer to a clue\n    spans $n$ squares, he\n    assigns the value $n$ to\n    the first of these squares, $n-1$ to the second square, and so on\n    ending with assigning $1$\n    to last square. The rank of any unsolved clue is then defined\n    as follows: for each square that already has a letter in it,\n    add the value assigned to that square to a running total. Then\n    divide this total by the sum of all the values assigned to that\n    clue to get that clue\u2019s rank. Once this is done for all the\n    clues, Will solves the clue with the highest rank. If there is\n    a tie, he selects an across clue over a down clue. If there is\n    still a tie he picks the clue with the smallest starting clue\n    number. After each clue is solved Will recalculates the\n    rankings before selecting the next highest ranked clue.\nAs an example, consider the crossword in Figure 1 where the\n    6-Across clue has already been solved (we\u2019ll used 6A as a\n    shorter specification for this clue). To determine the rank of\n    the 1-Down (1D) clue, Will first assigns the values\n    $3$, $2$ and $1$ to each of the squares going down.\n    Since the last square has a letter in it, the ranking of this\n    clue is $1/(3+2+1) = 1/6$.\n    In a similar fashion he determines that the ranking of clues 2D\n    and 3D are $2/10$ and the\n    ranking of 5D is $2/6$.\n    The rankings of the three unsolved across clues 1A, 4A and 7A\n    are all $0$. Thus the next\n    clue to solve is 5D (we\u2019ll be optimistic and always assume Will\n    can solve any clue). Once this is solved, the rankings of 4A\n    and 7A become $1/10$ and\n    $1/6$, respectively. Since\n    there is now a tie between the highest ranking clues (2D and\n    3D) and they are both down clues, Will picks the down clue with\n    the lowest clue number and solves 2D. Proceeding similarly, the\n    remaining clues are solved in the following order (with their\n    ranking at time of solution in parentheses): 7A ($4/6$), 4A ($4/10$), 3D ($6/10$) and 1A ($3/6$). Note that clue 1D is not on\n    the list, as it is completely solved by the previously solved\n    clues (namely 1A, 4A and 6A).\n\nFor this problem, you will be given a crossword puzzle grid\n    with zero or more squares already filled in and you must\n    determine the order in which unsolved clues should be solved.\n    The filled-in squares may or may not correspond to completely\n    solved clues.

{"title": "Vin Diagrams", "description": "Venn diagrams were invented by the great logician John Venn\n    as a way of categorizing elements belonging to different sets.\n    Given two sets $A$ and\n    $B$, two overlapping\n    circles are drawn \u2013 a circle representing the elements of\n    $A$, and another\n    representing the elements of $B$. The overlapping region of the\n    circles represents element that belong to both $A$ and $B$, i.e., the intersection of the two\n    sets $A \\cap B$. A classic\n    Venn diagram might look like this:\nOne of John\u2019s biggest fans was his grandson, Vin Vaughn\n    Venn. Vin was inspired by his grandfather\u2019s diagrams, but Vin\n    was a very creative individual. Simple overlapping circles\n    struck Vin as too boring of a way to visualize the sometimes\n    messy intersections of categories, so he set out to make his\n    grandfather\u2019s diagrams more interesting. Just like Venn\n    diagrams, Vin diagrams are used as a way of categorizing\n    elements belonging to different sets $A$ and $B$, but the representation of each\n    set is not required to be a circle. In fact, each set can have\n    any shape as long as there is single overlapping section for\n    elements in the intersection of $A$ and $B$.\nIn this problem, Vin diagrams will be laid out on a grid.\n    Each set representation is a loop of \u2018X\u2019\n    characters, with one \u2018X\u2019 in each loop\n    replaced by an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 to identify the loop. All empty positions (both\n    inside and outside of the loops) are represented by period\n    (\u2018.\u2019) characters, and the set of positions inside a loop is\n    contiguous. Each loop character touches exactly two other loop\n    characters either vertically or horizontally. Loops do not\n    self-intersect, and other than the allowed horizontal/vertical\n    paths and right angle connections, different parts of the loop\n    do not touch (see Figures 2 and 3 below).\nLoops A and B intersect at exactly two points. Loop\n    intersection points always follow the pattern shown in Figure 4\n    (including the four \u2018.\u2019 positions around the intersection). No\n    loop makes a right angle turn at an intersection point but\n    always flows straight through the intersection, either\n    vertically or horizontally. An example of legally intersecting\n    loops is shown in Figure 5.\n", "input_description": "The input starts with two integers $r$ $c$ describing the number of rows and\n    columns in the Vin diagram ($7\n    \\leq r, c \\leq 100$). The following $r$ rows each contain a string of\n    $c$ characters. All\n    positions that are not part of loop $A$ or loop $B$ are marked with a period (\u2018.\u2019)\n    character. The loop labels \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 are placed somewhere\n    around the loops\u2019 perimeters at non-intersection positions and\n    are never on the same loop. The two loops will touch only at\n    the two points where they intersect.", "output_description": "Display, in order, the area of the Vin diagram exclusive to\n    set $A$, the area\n    exclusive to set $B$, and\n    the area of the intersection. Given the representation of Vin\n    diagrams, the area of a section is defined as the number of\n    periods (\u2018.\u2019) it encloses.", "problem_class": "Medium", "problem_score": 9.1}
{"title": "Wrapping Trees", "description": "After last year\u2019s spectacular failure, the Alberta Christmas\n    Paraphernalia Company (ACPC) is getting an early start on their\n    Christmas tree business this year. With all the extra time they\n    have to prepare, the plan is to use some algorithmic methods to\n    optimize their profits.\nThe ACPC would like to wrap a single piece of string around\n    each tree so that they can tightly pack them into the\n    warehouse. The tree supplier has kindly sent you a\n    specification of the shapes of the trees. The cross section of\n    the tree that you want to wrap the string around can be\n    represented in compressed form by an $n$ by $n$ binary image, where each pixel\n    corresponds to a $1$ cm by\n    $1$ cm region of the tree.\n    Unfortunately, as trees are very complicated shapes, it would\n    take an infinite amount of time for you to download the\n    complete uncompressed image of a tree. Luckily, the trees are\n    of premium quality and thus have a very nice recursive\n    structure. The full uncompressed image of the tree can be\n    computed by recursively replacing every 1 pixel in the compressed image with a scaled\n    down copy of the entire image an infinite number of\n    times. Note that the dimensions of the full uncompressed\n    image are still $n$ cm by\n    $n$ cm, the same as the\n    compressed image.\nGiven a compressed specification of a tree, your task is to\n    find the shortest possible length of string (in centimeters)\n    that can wrap completely around the perimeter of all 1 pixels in the corresponding uncompressed\n    tree.\n", "input_description": "The first line of input will contain an integer $n$ denoting the both the height and\n    width of the compressed image in centimeters. You may assume\n    that $1\\le n\\le 10^3$. The\n    following $n$ lines will\n    contain $n$ characters.\n    Each character will be either a 0 or\n    1 describing the pixels of the\n    compressed image.", "output_description": "Output the smallest possible length of string that can\n    completely enclose all points in the uncompressed tree\n    corresponding to the given compressed tree.
